# 201-FINAL PROJECT

<!-- It would be nice to include a link here to the deployed version of your site! -->
201d43 Final project by Richard Jimenez, Jeremy Beck, Kristofer Riedman, Christina Gislason

Project: The Four Horsemen of the  201pocalypse 

Description: This is a quirky, fun quiz that presents a user with nine questions alongside their respective images. The user answers each question and after submitting their answers, they are directed to a results page that displays which CODE 201 staff that they are most matched with. 

Problem Domain: Our quiz allows any code fellow to identify the burning question of which CODE 201 Staff is the equivalent of being their spirit animal.  


## CONFLICT RESOLUTION


We will try to avoid having members from inadequately contributing to the project by cultivating an open dialogue and assigning work corporately.

We will resolve any conflicts that arise by opening up discussions and also assessing if there is actually a conflict as opposed to there having been a misunderstanding.

We will escalate the conflict if any attempts are unsuccessful and when an individual is not receptive to team suggestions or concerns. At this point, we will approach a TA or instructor to participate in mediating a resolution.


##  COMMUNICATION PLAN


Our team has agreed that it will be optional to work on the project outside of class hours. If anyone opts for this, they will work on their branch and merge only after the  team reviews the work the following morning. Outside of class hours, we will communicate via Slack. 
We will ensure everyone's voices are heard. After any proposals or questions are posed, we will open up the floor for  	discussions. 

We want to create a safe environment where  everyone feels comfortable speaking up by being constructive in our communication and giving each other our full attention whenever a team member would like to discuss an issue.

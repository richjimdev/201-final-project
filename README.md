# 201-final-project
201d43 Final project. Richard, Jeremy, Christina, Kris

## CONFLICT RESOLUTION


We will try to avoid having members from inadequately contributing to the project by cultivating an open dialogue and assigning work corporately.

We will resolve any conflicts that arise by opening up discussions and also assessing if there is actually a conflict as opposed to there having been a misunderstanding.

We will escalate the conflict if any attempts are unsuccessful and when an individual is not receptive to team suggestions or concerns. At this point, we will approach a TA or instructor to participate in mediating a resolution.


##  COMMUNICATION PLAN


Our team has agreed that it will be optional to work on the project outside of class hours. If anyone opts for this, they will work on their branch and merge only after the  team reviews the work the following morning. Outside of class hours, we will communicate via Slack. 
We will ensure everyone's voices are heard. After any proposals or questions are posed, we will open up the floor for  	discussions. 

We want to create a safe environment where  everyone feels comfortable speaking up by being constructive in our communication and giving each other our full attention whenever a team member would like to discuss an issue.

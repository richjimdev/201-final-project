        <h2>Christina Gislason</h2>
        <p>Christina has a keen eye and appreciation for weird, beautiful things like ice flowers and parasitic sea pig snails. She’s currently obsessed with blockchain, harp jazz/UK R&B, and could waste hours of her life watching instructional cooking shows (NOT the gamefied variety!) if she wasn’t so busy tending to her Korean-Icelandic-Puerto Rican hybrid babies and learning to code.</p> 
        <p>She was once bitten by an ostrich and it was entirely her fault.</p>

        <h2>Jeremy Beck</h2>
        <p>Jeremy is an avid outdoorsman and enjoys backpacking through all the national parks, but is just as happy being a bum on the couch. He likes to think he can cook like Julia Childs and strives to master the perfect baguette.</p>
        <p>He took a solo backpacking trip around the world that took him from Europe to the Middle East to Southeast Asia and Mt Everest. He is always looking for his next adventure!</p>

        <p>His favorite activities include playing video games, watching movies, and exploring faraway places with his wife. Fun fact: Kris has spent a full six months of his life underground.</p>

        <h2>Christina Gislason</h2>
        <p>Christina has a keen eye and appreciation for weird, beautiful things like ice flowers and parasitic sea pig snails. She’s currently obsessed with blockchain, harp jazz/UK R&B, and could waste hours of her life watching instructional cooking shows (NOT the gamefied variety!) if she wasn’t so busy tending to her Korean-Icelandic-Puerto Rican hybrid babies and learning to code.</p> 
        <p>She was once bitten by an ostrich and it was entirely her fault.</p>

        <p>Jeremy is an avid outdoorsman and enjoys backpacking through all the national parks, but is just as happy watching Netflix on the couch. He likes to think he can cook like Julia Childs and strives to master the perfect baguette.</p>
        <p>He took a solo backpacking trip around the world that took him from Europe to the Middle East to Southeast Asia and Mt Everest. He is always looking for his next adventure!</p>
